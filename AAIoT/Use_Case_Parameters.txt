Parameters of the use case that we are looking for:

1. Large quantities of data need to be generated - sensors that are transmitting often
2. IoT related - small sensors
3. Not video - this area is too explored
4. Not solved by ML - this area is also too explored
5. Must have meaningful sensor component - be able to aggregate data on sensor.
6. Must have meaningful cloud component - data from many sensors analyzed on the cloud 
7. Many sensors each collecting a lot of data in the same place/area.

Potential use cases:

1. Industrial.

Since the lifetime of industrial equipment is measured in years, in this use case sensors are not collecting 
continuously but sample data at pre-determined time periods.

2. Medical.

Data can not leave the hospital, which means that there is no cloud component to the query. Everything is essentially
on the edge already.
