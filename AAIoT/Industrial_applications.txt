Wavelet pre-processing in Industrial applications.

What are current predictive maintenance approaches?

ML

What kind of preprocessing is performed for these approaches:

Logarithmic transformation




Do they require wavelet data preprocessing:

Denoising

Missing Data inputation

Signal normalization

This article specifically talks about bearing predictive maintenance using accelerometers. However, considering 
that lifetime of a bearing is 3-4 years, sensor has sleep mode during which it does not collect any data and 
the bearing is sampled at some intervals, without the need to collect data from it continuously.
    This means that the amount of data generated by this bearing sensor will not be large, even though the sensor
is capable of collecting often, it will not generate large amounts of data over time.
