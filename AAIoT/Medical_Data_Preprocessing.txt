This is a very explored area with many proposed architectures. Any signal processing is quite well explored.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Signal/Missing Value inputation. (Upsampling)

Could not find dedicated accelerators. In software this is usually computed using libraries or in MATLAB.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Signal Normalization: convert all signals to same value.

Existing Accelerators:
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00034-019-01262-3 - nothing is said about it being small or portable

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6542014 - power efficient


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Incompliant (with human life) Signal Values Filtering

Could not find dedicated accelerators. In software this is usually computed using libraries or in MATLAB.

Do we need a small accelerator? All machines in the hospital room are plugged in, so this is not exactly IoT 
where processors need to be ultra-low power. An existing circuit can be put onto the sensor and used to do 
preprocessing.

Why would we pre-process the values on the sensor in the first place? Hospital server is essentially the edge
node. Process everything there.

Looking deeper into wearable medical devices:

1. Data from remote patient monitoring:
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7527444

What about data coming from inpatient sensors directly in the hospital? Does it make sense to analyze some of it on 
the sensor directly?

Data from inpatient sensors is currently going to the server inside the hospital. Some objections for that data to 
go to the cloud are:

1. There is not much aggregation going on anyway, so the amount of data is likely to increase instead of decreasing. 
The data is filtered, denoised, missing values are put in, normalized, then fed into analysis software (often ML) or 
visualization software for the doctor.

2. Sensors are performing some preliminary denoising and filtering on the data according to:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332823913_Edge_and_Fog_Computing_in_Healthcare_-_A_Review

3. It makes sense that hospital server act as an edge node: 
    - if data would be transferred to the cloud, then it would have to include a lot of metadata 
    (much more than the data itself), so we would be inflating the amount of transferred data; 
    - inside the hospital, much smaller amount of data would be transferred directly across hospital network.
    - to avoid loss of access to the data over the internet, data should be stored inside the hospital, which 
    means that raw data is sent to the cloud, analyzed there, then results plus raw data will be sent back to hospital.
    Then a legitimate question is: why not analyze data on the edge node inside the hospital?
    - currently health data is not allowed to leave the hospital.

4. Doctors actually look at raw ECG waveform when performing analysis.

5. Cloud could act as secondary records storage, but even that is doubtful because of privacy concerns and 
internet connection concerns.




Use the case of ecg data. Detect abnormal ecg patterns and send them to the doctor who can then make an appointment.
See if we can have a pipeline on sensors: transform -> filter -> scaling -> analysis.

Potential application:
autonomous robots?


Hi Gennady I know we talked about it only yesterday, but when I started looking at implementing window queries looking for disorders, I found that this idea has essentially been already commercialized:

This sensor uses a smartphone app to detect abnormalities in EKG:
https://www.amazon.ca/Alivecor-AL-KARDIAMOBILE-Kardia-Mobile/dp/B01A4W8AUK

This paper proposes a sensor for long term analysis and Arythmia detection:
https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/8/11/1300

This paper explored essentially what my next step would be, but from power consumption standpoint of a mobile phone. They explored 3 scenarios: 
1. Ecg data forwarding to the server through smartphone
2. Limited processing on a smartphone - basic filtering, feature extraction, data forwarding
3. Arrhythmia detection, then data forwarding
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-11128-5_166

This paper discusses limitations and challenges to smartphone-based assessment of cardiovascular diseases using ECG 
and PPG. Among the challenges the cite is implementation of complex ECG analysis algorithms on smartphones:
"Though smartphones nowadays have improved processors, they are still inadequate for the implementation of complex ECG 
analysis algorithms. These algorithms used to run in high processors of laptops and PCs. The implementation of these 
algorithms in a smartphone can improve the analysis, and the number of abnormalities is detected."
https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-01199-7

This paper from 2013 proposes another such system. On the page in the link there are a lot of papers proposing 
the same thing basically:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24110176/

Finally, this article describes our use case exactly:
https://www.practicalcardiology.com/view/livmor-halo-af-detection-system-receives-510-k-clearance-from-fda
FDA approved Samsung sensor (https://www.livmor.com/#about) Livmor Halo is worn on the wrist and it detects cardiac
disorders and connects with physicians through a cloud based portal.

So I am not sure how useful it is to explore ECG use case, since it is essentially commercialized.
