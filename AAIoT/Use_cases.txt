1. Power usage:
Power sensors usually measure once every 15-20 seconds, so not much data there

Found papers that attempt to optimize for measuring intervals to reduce data and battery consumption in IoT sensors.

Bottom line for sensors is:
In general for these sensors, people think of smart collection strategies instead of continuously collecting.
