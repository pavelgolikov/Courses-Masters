3 main motivating points:

1. Compare total amount of incoming data and total amount of existing cloud compute and argue that there is not enough
compute

Key question: what is the good ratio between IoT compute and cloud compute.

By how much can our approach reduce the amount of data? Depends on:
- Ratio of compute edge handles compared to cloud
- IoT application in question

How to classify the apps and estimate data savings?
We can propose several classes of accelerators that would go into different devices based on size, power, and compute
needs.

Next tasks:

- Think of meaningful statistics that could be computed on IoT devices.

- Think of applications that you WANT run on the IoT device that are not run right now because there is not enough
compute on the device.
    - Talk to Eyal's group to find what is done currently on IoT and edge and what would they WANT to be done there.

2. Compare price of computing on the cloud on raw data vs price of processing simple queries on simple machines on the
edge and argue that it is cheaper to filter on the edge and deliver summarized data to cloud.

Next tasks:

Pick a provider like Samsung and look at volume of sold IoT devices, look at what that device collects and calculate the
amount of data that needs to be analyzed. Calculate how much it would cost to analyze it on the cloud vs on the device
and compare in terms of TFLOPS or IPC. Use m6g.16xlarge reserved instance on AWS vs some cheap ARM chip (purely in
terms of cost for now). Put yourself in the shoes of the decision maker and go from there.

Since the devices are likely to be collected from for 5 years, scale the data by 5 years.

3. Compare the total amount of traffic required for the data and argue that network can be a serious bottleneck. Data
movement is much more expensive than compute in terms of time and energy - expand on that and look at CSC2224 lecture
for more justification.
