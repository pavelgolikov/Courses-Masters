Know your client. If you want to contribute to state of the art, you need to be in both camps: industry and academia.
Example: Wilkes (discussed Temporal locality) and IBM (discussed spatial locality becaue it influcenced them more).

is 3D stacking likely to improve anything or is it decoding itself?
does it access many layers at hte same time to avoid adding the latency?

The more cores you have, the more contexts -> the more associativity you will need -> need layers of cache shared by
more cores to have higher associativity.
