Memory can be up to 40% of the datacenter and clour nodes.

Programming accelerators is still very fresh and only about 10% is solved.

High level synthesis produces bad performance.
Synthesizing with Verilog takes a lot of time to write and verify and test.

So how to program accelerators efficiently?

Don't artificially limit yourself to looking for solution in the convenient place and look everywhere.

Aim high to have impact by the time you report/publish your results.

Your insight, not performance numbers or design, is what transfers into the future and creates impact.

Idea: have markers in memory that represent bounds for data structures. If an element of that data structure is
operated on, we bring the whole data structure into the cache. Make memory operations semantic.

Review of Dark Silicon:

Unlimited power and fixed parallelism - 10% speedup
100% parallelism and limited power - 15% speedup

This means that the fact that we have a power budget does not constrain us (because even with unlimited power budget we
would still get 10% speedup) in terms of dark silicon. It is the fact that we have to turn on many cores to process
many parallel threads that is constraining us.
