Project Accelerated Analytics on IOT devices.

With massive expansion of IOT devices there will be a lot of data moving around. Correspondingly, there will be the need
to analyze and process all of this data.

Aim of this project is as follows:

1. Analyze the operations and data movement in common IOT devices.
2. Analyze the computation demands of those operations.
3. Potentially propose interesting hardware to accelerate data analytics.

What Are IoT Devices?
An IoT device is a piece of hardware with a sensor that transmits data from one place to another over the Internet.
Types of IoT devices include wireless sensors, software, actuators, and computer devices. They can be imbedded into
mobile devices, industrial equipment, environmental sensors, medical devices, and more. Connected IoT devices, which
convey usage and other data, can potentially provide insights that lead companies to cost reductions, efficiency gains,
and new business opportunities.



General questions:

At which point do we analyze things? At the device? At the cloud?

Where would I find the following info:

What kind of data IOT devices collect?

Current Stage:

Ways to classify:
Classify by physics -> data types -> operations
Classify by use -> data types -> operations
Classify by target -> are they tracking you or the environment?
Classify by type -> physical data (pressure, temperature etc...) vs readily analyzable data (video, voice etc...)



In terms of physics, what kind of data can IoT devices collect:

Sound
- Speech detection
- Music

Video
- Security systems
- Doorbells

Motion Sensing
- Security systems

Vibration
- Various sensors
- Heartbeat
- Seismic sensors

Temperature
- Human
- Outside
- Safety systems

Location
- Tracking - very popular, especially for industrial IoT devices
- Reccomendation systems

Tilt Detection
- Quality control
- Safety

Pressure (by extention: Altitude, Depth, Flow, Leak)
- Safety
- Industrial - cargo tracking

Electrical
- Current
- Power - very popular for energy savings

Communication
- Antennas

Chemical
- Safety and security
- Air quality monitoring
- CO2 detection
- Dangerous chemical detection - Industrial IoT devices


Most data is collected over time for tracking/analysis purposes.
Any combination of the above types of data can and are collected.

What is industry doing with IOT devices?


Anand meeting notes:

At first, targeting hospital, now 5G, IOT devices.

Classify devices by the type of data they collect. Classify data. and go from there.

Video quering - one of the areas where people explore.

Google talks about problems people face with big data.
