Main sources of data:

-video uploading devices

Biggest uses:

Surveillance cameras and connected cars. ~ 40 million total together.

Surveillance (assuming 12 hours a day): 20,000,000 * 12 hours a day * 2Mb/sec = 216 Petabytes /day
Connected cars (assuming 2 hours a day): 20,000,000 * 2 hours a day * 2Mb/sec = 36 Petabytes /day

Total is 252 petabytes per day from just these two sources.

What kind of accelerator is possible for surveillance? animal detection, traffic cameras, etc...

Smart cities account for the biggest IoT device usage sector.


take main sources of data and how much compute would be needed to handle it.
estimate how much you can process.
How fast to run a simple query on that kind of data.

We are coming to territory that is infeasible

How massive is the amount of data coming in and how much compute is needed to handle it?

Figure out magnitude of categories and estimate hwo much data they can generate in an minute/hour?

Frequency of how often collected. Make a range for each category.
look at the manuals of the devices and with what frequencies.
pick devices that generate large amounts of data first.

Microsoft project with farms where they could not send live videos.

Categorize by compute complexity and types of data generated.

3 main arguments we can make:

1. Compare total amount of incoming data and total amount of existing cloud compute and argue that there is not enough
compute

Number in the spreadsheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GFZk2uijFLzISh6rNzd9tjekB9S0XOWX9leOn5GN_lA/edit?usp=sharing

Maybe estimate video data separately and analyze compute for it separately because it takes more compute than normal
data?

Key question: what is the good ratio between IoT compute and cloud compute.

By how much can our approach reduce the amount of data? Depends on:
- Ratio of compute edge handles compared to cloud
- IoT application in question

How to classify the apps and estimate data savings?
We can propose several classes of accelerators that would go into different devices based on size, power, and compute
needs.

Quantize data if possible
Filter data
Summarize data

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Compare price of computing on the cloud on raw data vs price of processing simple queries on simple machines on the
edge and argue that it is cheaper to filter on the edge and deliver summarized data to cloud.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Compare the total amount of traffic required for the data and argue that network can be a serious bottleneck. Data
movement is much more expensive than compute in terms of time and energy - expand on that and look at CSC2224 lecture
for more justification.
