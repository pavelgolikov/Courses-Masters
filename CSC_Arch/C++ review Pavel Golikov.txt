RowClone paper review by Pavel Golikov (Student Number 994973230)

1. Brief Summary of the paper:


Key ideas of the paper are as follows:

Key insight of the paper is that  a DRAM row can induce disturbances in nearby rows due to voltage fluctuations.


2. Strengths of the paper:

- Like that they support low level atomic operations that allow the programmer to explicitly specify memory
ordering constraints, which allows very careful programmer to implement near optimal code. (Section 6).

3. Paper's weaknesses:

- In Section 3, making trylock fail "spurously" makes it very counterintuitive for programmers.

4. Suggestions/Feedback:

I liked that in the paper.
