Why parallelism?

Throughput
Hardware utilization (one app is never going to use up all resources -> put more things on device to make the units busy
Power consumption

When trading parameters, not all parameters can be linearly related -> review physics

Why not increase instruction window? Data dependencies are scaling quadratically.
