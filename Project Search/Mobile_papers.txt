Simulators and tools:

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8675198
Gable: bottleneck analysis model by Mark Hill and Vijay. This tool is made to help in early design stages of SOC
development. IPs that SOC will use are selected and each of the selected IPs is modeled with a simple roofline model 
and then the tool combines the results and models the bottlenecks in the SOC that would result from using the IPs 
selected. In future work authors say: "While Gables models each IP with a simple roofline, future work could 
incorporate more-sophisticated sub-models, regarding on-chip memory trade-offs, IP interaction overheads, 
specific IPs like GPUs, etc."

META: trace based tool for facilitating the exploration of memory hierarchies in mobile devices.

Emerald: simulator that allows studying system-level SOC interactions while including graphics impact. Basically this
is Tor Aamodt extending his GPGPU simulator to mobile SOCs. This is said to be able to simulate full SOCs.

MofySim: full system simulator that analyses energy consumption and performance for various apps (including browser).
The reason browser is always mentioned is because it has become by far the biggest app for smartphones in terms of 
usage and one of the biggest in terms of resource consumption. This simulator uses modified gem5 and Android image 
to simulate full system. I read the paper and the focus seems to be on correctly modelling various network 
behaviour and evaluating the system under these various behaviours. They do not focus so much on the IPs inside the 
SOC itself. After reading the paper, I read more on SOC and different phone components and it looks to me that most
of the IPs don't actually communicate much and the dataflow is in most cases going along the sensor/IP pipeline either
to or from the CPU or the other way around: from CPU to sensor/IP pipeline and then to user or network.

Mocktails: a methodology to synthetically recreate the varying spatio-temporal memory access behaviour of proprietary 
heterogeneous compute devices. Tool is supposed to help architects evaluate their architectures by substituting
Mocktails for proprietary compute devices in simulations. This paper is by Natalie's student by the way.

Mobile centric CPU optimizations:

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8574592
CritICs Critiquing Criticality in Mobile Apps
This paper caught my eye. Authors show that existing CPU optimizations that we are used to that target server/scientific
workloads are not as effective in mobile CPUs, so they propose to group instructions into what they call Critical 
Instruction Chains and implement a software solution in the compiler that improves fetch bandwidth of these 
instructions. I thought that this might be an interesting direction: compare how well common server-level optimizations 
are performing in mobile platforms and perhaps look at different optimizations that would improve the performance.

Mobile CPU's rise to power.
Quantifying the impact of generational mobile CPU design trends on performance, energy, 
and user satisfaction. Authors try to bridge the gap between cpu optimizations that were performed and user experience
for mobile platforms. They build a tool to determine how much the optimizations will affect user experience.
-Vijay's paper

Propose heterogeneous cores on a single CPU chip based on the workloads mentioned above?

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6844468 ISPASS 2014
Study of thread level parallelism on mobile devices. Authors conclude that mobile applications rarely use more than 2
cores, which means putting more cores on device is not likely to improve performance by much.

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6114205 !!
Full-system analysis and characterization of interactive smartphone applications. Quote from abstract:
    "We demonstrate that real-world interactive smartphone applications differ markedly from the SPEC suite. Specifically 
the instruction cache, instruction TLB, and branch predictor suffer from poor performance. We conjecture that this is 
due to the applications' reliance on numerous high level software abstractions (shared libraries and OS services). 
Similar trends have been observed for UI-intensive interactive applications on the desktop".

Performance, energy characterizations and architectural implications of an emerging mobile platform benchmark suite - 
MobileBench. Authors propose a mobile benchmark suite MobileBench and perform the study of currect (in 2013) mobile
cores. Authors also perform a sensitivity study of TLB, L2, and branch predictor on their proposed MobileBench suite.

QOS and User Experience:

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7446053
Improving smartphone user experience by balancing performance and energy with probabilistic QoS guarantee. 

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7056028  !!
Authors propose the concept of energy-efficient QoS (eQoS) to capture the trade-off between QoS and energy consumption. 
Event based scheduling selectively slows down events that wouldn't affect use experience to save energy.

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7783756
Pretty much the same goal as paper above: reach user defined QOS while being energy efficient.

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7856623
In this paper, authors present a predictive DVFS controller that predicts the execution time of a job before it
executes in order to appropriately set the DVFS level to just meet user response-time deadlines. Our results show 56% 
energy savings compared to running tasks at the maximum frequency with almost no deadline misses.

Component (IP) coordination:

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7056029  !!
Domain knowledge based energy management in handhelds.
This paper proposes a coordinated multicomponent energy optimization mechanism for handheld devices, where the energy
profile of different components such as CPU, memory, GPU and IP cores are considered in unison to trigger the 
appropriate DVFS state by exploiting the application domain knowledge. Specifically, we show that for the important 
class of frame-based applications, the domain knowledge - frame processing rates, component utilization and available l
slack - can be used to decide effective DVFS states for each component from among the numerous choices. 
    The paper essentially does what Vijay is talking about (considering the communication between different IPs) 
but for a group of applications. 

https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2749469.2750382 !!
Virtualizing IPs.
This paper also proposes coordination of IPs for user-interactive and display based applications for the goal of avoiding
unnecessary data transfers through memory and avoiding unnecessary CPU involvement in running those applications.
    Basically addresses that same problem of IP device communication, but for interactive applications - same as
previous paper.

Short-Circuiting memory traffic in handheld platforms. Pretty much self explanatory. Another proposal for IP-IP
communication by Chita.
