1. Discuss what I found on the phone.
    - Really not clear what is going on: a lot of the files return "unimplemented".
    - So far found: temperature, gpu utilization, image not clear

2. Discuss Development Board and lack of info on it
    - No manual found
    - Will have to purchase all components
    - Likely will only be able to profile CPU, GPU

3. Discuss Email to VJ to talk about the other 2 potential projects.
    - Talk about our concerns about hitting a wall and not making progress
    - Is IP co-design project realistic without internship/insider knowledge? From VJ's opinion.
    - Talk about more likely candidate (BenchMark/hardware optimizations for Android Stack).
